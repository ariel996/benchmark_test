### BENCHMARKING TEST
The script allows to generate a fixed CPU load for a finite or indefinite time period, for one or more CPU cores.

The script takes in input the desired CPU load and the CPU core on which the load has to be generated. The controller and
the CPU monitor are implemented in two different Threads.
